# Day 12. Files (reading and writing)
## Today's objective 

Learn how to work with files in Python:
- Opening and closing files.
- Reading and writing data.
- Understanding file modes (r, w, a, r+).
- Using context managers (`with open(...)`).

## Explanation 
In Python, the built-in function `open()` is used to interact with files.

**Basic syntax:**

```python 
file = open("example.txt", "r") #open file in read mode 
content = file.read()
file.close()
```
but the safer and more common way is using a context manager 
```python 
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
# file is automatically closed here 
```
### Common Modes
- `"r"` â†’ read (default). Error if file doesnâ€™t exist.
- `"w"` â†’ write (creates a new file or overwrites existing one).
- `"a"` â†’ append (adds to the end without overwriting).
- `"r+"` â†’ read and write.

### Reading 
```python
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    print(file.read())        # all content
    # print(file.readline())  # one line
    # print(file.readlines()) # list of lines 
```
### Writting 
```python
with open("output.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, Marcel!\n")
    file.write("This is a new file.") 
```
## Small note 
> Files are everywhere - logs, configs, datasets. Being comfortable with reading and writing files is key for data science, web development, and automation.

> Pro tip: Always use with open(...) to avoid forgetting to close the file and risking memory leaks or locked files ðŸŒ±
