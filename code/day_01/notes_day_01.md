# Day 01: Introduction, `print`, variables.
## Today's objetive
Get familiar with Python's basic syntax, learn to display information on screen using `print()` and declare variables correctly. 

## What is Python?
Pyhthon is a hight level, interpreted programming language with very clear syntax. It's used in web development, data science, artificial intelligence, automation, and many other fields. 

**Advantages of Python:**

- Simple and clear syntax

- Large comunity

- Vast library collection

- Cross-platfor

## First command: `print()`
It's  a built-in function that displays messages in the console.

```python
print('Â¡Hola, Mundo!')
```
for multiple lines 
```python
print('Ein \nZwei \nDrei')
```

## Variables: Storing  Information 
A variable is a container for storing values. In Python, you don't need to declare the type. 

```python
name = 'Natalia'
cat_name = 'Felix'
print('This is my name: ', name)
print('This is the name of cat: ', cat_name)
```
you can use `type()` to check a variable's data type

```python
age = 26
print(type(age))
```

### Variable Naming Best Practices
- Use descriptive names *(e.g., user_age instead of ua)*
- Use lowercase with underscore (snake_case)
*(e.g., total_score, is_valid_user)*
- Avoid language reserved words *(e.g., if, for, print, etc.)*
- No special characters *(e.g., @, $)*

## Small note
Programming starts with small steps. If you understand print and variables, then you can create your first scripts without any problem ðŸŒ±
