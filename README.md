# 30 Days of Python Fundamentals

Hello!  
This repository is part of my goal to improve my mastery of the Python language through daily activities, starting from the very basics to achieving a solid foundation for future personal projects.

---

## Objective

To condense, organize, and improve my knowledge of the language in order to have a solid understanding of its fundamentals.

---

## General Content

- Basic syntax and language structures.
- Built-in data structures (lists, dictionaries, tuples, sets).
- Functions, using modules, and organizing code efficiently.
- Introduction to object-oriented programming.
- Creating small automations and useful scripts.
- Working with files, debugging errors, and using Python ecosystem tools.

---

## Challenge Structure

The challenge is divided into 30 days. Each day includes:

- A central topic.
- An explanation or notebook.
- Practice exercises.
- (Sometimes) Personal reflection or notes.

This repository is a personal project, but if you want to follow the challenge, you're welcome to do so.
You can create your own version with a fork or leave comments/suggestions in the issues. Keep in mind that I'm not an expert in this area and there are topics I know and others where I'll also be completely new. This is a learning and exploration exercise but in a more organized way.
